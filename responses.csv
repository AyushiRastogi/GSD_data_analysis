My contribution there was very small, as we did not use it a lot.  But I guess this is a good example of the not very well documented project. this is the main obstacle for me when I would like to get involved in some project - not very clear README, missing documentation regarding code discipline for a particular project, not clear rules on how to get involved. That would be for me the main blocker.","I don't contribute to this project anymore, in general, I think I pushed 1 or 2 things there, so it's one of the projects that I really don't fell that I am involved in. The main reason for that is that I don't work for the company in which GitHub organization this project is living and I don't use it for any other project.  So this is the project that has a really low priority for me. In my free time, I prefer to invest my time in other open-source projects.

If there is a lack of women participating in open source projects, have you considered it might be because there are fewer female engineers than male ones? Having said that, maybe the solution is to get more female engineers in general. However, I really don't know the statistics in this regard. Maybe I'm biased but what I see in my day-to-day work is that we embrace contributions from anyone, no matter the gender, whether someone prefers indentation with tabs or spaces, etc. I perceive the larger IT engineering community to be very welcoming to everyone.","Man","","l.
